## Current Plan

### Localize to Korean and Modernize CSS

1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Update the blueprint to reflect the localization and new design plan.
2.  **Update `index.html`:** Translate all user-facing text content to Korean. Set the language attribute of the HTML tag to `ko`.
3.  **Update `style.css`:** Replace the existing stylesheet with a modern 2025-themed design. This includes using CSS variables, a new color palette, updated typography for Korean, glassmorphism-inspired card styles, and enhanced interactivity with animations and hover effects.
